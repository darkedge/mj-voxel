RenderTexture calls glBindFrameBuffer and glViewport
	Let Camera class call glClear
Display options (including borderless window)
Typedef const char * to something meaningful
Command buffer?

- Traverse to current element
	- for all funcs in traversal, execute
		(these are simply get functions)
- execute _get function (put it on the stack)
	- for globals, this is lua_getglobal
	- otherwise, custom
- if functor, call it(1), null it
- convert from stack to value
- clear stack
- return value

global Reference has no traversal stack, uses lua_getglobal and lua_setglobal

for [] operator:
create copy of traversal stack
put current get in copy
create table get and set functions
create table reference
